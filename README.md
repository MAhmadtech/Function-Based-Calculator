# Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
- Handles floating-point numbers
- Includes error handling for invalid operations and division by zero
- User-friendly input interface

## Installation

No installation required. This is a Python script that can be run directly.

## Usage

1. Run the calculator.py script:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the first number
   - Enter the second number
   - Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)

3. The calculator will display the result of the operation

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 5.5
Enter the second number: 2.5
choose an operation (+,-,*,/): *
5.5 * 2.5 is equal to 13.75
```

## Error Handling

- Invalid operators will be rejected
- Division by zero is prevented
- Non-numeric inputs will cause a ValueError

## Implementation Details

- Written in Python
- Uses basic arithmetic operations
- Includes type conversion for floating-point numbers
- Implements basic error handling

## Note

This is a simple calculator implementation for educational purposes. For more complex calculations, consider using a scientific calculator or specialized mathematical software.
